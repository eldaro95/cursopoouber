## POO - Platzi

This is part of my POO course in Platzi. I want to share with you this project. It's a superficial representation about Uber system considering the creation of objects, methods, constructors and other tools.

## Structure

We have developed a simple UML to explain Uber's app functionality. We assume a lot of reductions to make it simple but understandable.Â
